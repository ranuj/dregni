After experimenting a bit with django-schedule and the events app from django-basic-apps, I decided I needed something much simpler for documenting events in a historical context. The focus of dregni is on creating a timeline of events that have already occurred, with only limited support for future events. In particular, there's no support for recurring events.

The application is named after Michael Dregni, noted biographer of our favorite gypsy-jazz guitarist, Django Reinhardt.
